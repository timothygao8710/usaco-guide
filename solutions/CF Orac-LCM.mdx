## Solution: Prime Factorization

For each prime, the second-to-lowest exponent of the prime that occurs in any of the numbers in the input is the exponent of this prime that will appear in the final answer. 

Here's a short solution that accomplishes this without explicitly computing any prime factorizations!

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
using ll = long long;

ll a,b; 
// a stores minimum exponents
// b stores second minimum exponents
int n;

void red() { // restore invariant mentioned above
    ll g = __gcd(a,b);
    tie(a,b) = make_pair(g,a/g*b);
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> a >> b;
    red();
    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        ll x; cin >> x; 
        b = __gcd(b,x);
        red();
    }
    cout << b << endl;
}
```

If it's hard to understand what exactly this code is doing at first glance, a good first step is to simulating the code in the case where each $a_i$ is a power of the same prime (say, $2^k$). If the algorithm works for this case, then it will also work in the general case since the contributions of different primes are computed independently and multiplied together.

<!-- the GCD function is [multiplicative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_function). -->

## Solution: GCD/LCM
Consider fixing an index $j$. How can the gcd of all lcms of $\text{a}[j]$ and all numbers $\text{a}[i]$ ($1 \leq i < j$) (such that $i$ is in range $[0,j]$) be quickly computed? The result would be $\text{a}[j]*C$, where $C$ is the gcd of all $\text{a}[i]$, and we can keep track of this gcd on the run.

Taking the gcd of all results for each $j$ gives the answer.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class ocralcm {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        int N = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
        int[] nums = new int[N];
        
        for(int i=0; i<N; i++){
            nums[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
        }

        long gcd = gcd(nums[0], nums[1]);
        long ret = nums[0]/gcd * nums[1];
        for(int i = 2; i<N; gcd = gcd(gcd, nums[i]), i++){
            ret = gcd(ret, lcm(nums[i], gcd));
        }
        System.out.println(ret);
    }
    
    static long lcm(long a, long b){
        return a/gcd(a,b) * b;
    }      
    
    static long gcd(long a, long b){
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}

```
